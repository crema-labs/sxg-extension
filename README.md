# SXG Extension

A simple devtools extension for creating web proofs on website that have SXGs enabled. For our POC implementation we simply forward the content you want to prove and the url to a server (will soon be open source!) that generates proofs for it. Once we get the SP1 prover network tracking id we poll for the proof continuously until the proof is generated.
